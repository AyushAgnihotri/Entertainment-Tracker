### Description :

#### Approach-1 :

The URL of a TV series on IMDb website has the following format :

 `https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1632701/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1` 

, where `tt1632701` is TitleId of TV-series with Title "Suits". Titles of each and every TV-series and movie are mapped with different TitleId's which can not be generated by simple logic. In order to get the TitleId values of TV series, the dataset([title.akas.tsv.gz](https://datasets.imdbws.com/)) of IMDb TV-series and Movies is used. The description of datasets are found here -[IMDb datasets](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/).
The dataset is stored in MySQL database as `imdb.akas(titleId, ordering, title, region, language, types, attributes, isOriginalTitle)`.[Python script for storing dataset in database can be found in [Entertainment-tracker/Approach1/](https://github.com/AyushAgnihotri/Entertainment-tracker/tree/master/Approach1)]. The corresponding TitleId's of Movies or TV-series with similar name are stored in a list. Each title Id is used to scrape the content of website of TV-series or Movie checked sequentially whether it is TV-series till a TV-series is found. The scraped page is searched for the hyperlink of latest season of that TV-series. Using hyperlink of latest season, the information of all its episodes is scraped and Airdates are stored. Stored airdates are further compared with current date and output is send to the user's email address using gmail SMTP.

#### Approach-2 :

The name of TV-series is searched as `imdb tvseries : "TV_SERIES"` over `www.google.co.in/` via google search package (assuming the topmost link of google search result to be most relevant). The topmost link is scraped and hyperlink for latest season is fetched. Using hyperlink of latest season, the information of all its episodes is scraped and Airdates are stored. Stored airdates are further compared with current date and output is send to the user's email address using gmail SMTP.

#### Approach-3 :
The name of TV-series is searched over imdb website as `https://www.imdb.com/find?ref_=nv_sr_fn&q=suits&s=all` (where "suits" is a TV series), the page is scraped and all the hyperlinks of TV-series or Movies with similar name are stored. Stored hyperlinks are further scraped sequentially and check whether they are of a TV series. Hyperlink found to be of a TV series is considered to be relevant and scraped. The scraped page is further used to fetch the hyperlink of latest season of that TV series. Using hyperlink of latest season, the information of all its episodes is scraped and Airdates are stored. Stored airdates are further compared with current date and output is send to the user's email address using gmail SMTP.
